Springboard Groups integrates Organic Groups with Springboard.

It does this by both limiting and extending the functionality of the Organic Groups module.

Limiting:

Organic groups allows almost any entity type to be a group. Springboard Groups only
interacts with a single group content type, the "springboard_group" content type.

Organic groups allows almost any entity type to be a group content. Springboard Groups disallows
some specific entities from being groupable within Springboard Groups.

Organic Groups' group selector widget is complex, with multiple input fields and multiple select options.
 Springboard Groups alters the widget to be a single input field, with a choice of either multiple or
 single select options. Single select options are forced on some entity types which cannot belong to
 multiple groups.

Organic groups allows for a myriad of configuration options for group types, group content,
group roles, group fields and group permissions. Springboard Groups provides a stripped down admin UI,
and menu alters the native OG configuration pages to be hidden with a custom access permission. Springboard
Groups does not provide a UI for custom roles, custom fields, multiple group types, etc.

Extending:

Springboard Groups adds a Group Context selector which appears on non-node pages, such as
the Springboard Dashboard view, which allows content listings on those pages to be filtered by a group
selection. Filtering is done via views query and page alter hooks. Filtering for users who belong to a
single group is done in the background, without a context selector.

Springboard Groups integrates with the Springboard Advocacy API, allowing remote content on the API server
to belong to Springboard Groups, and individual Springboard Groups to have custom Advocacy subscription settings.

Springboard Groups integrates with email wrappers, page wrappers, payment methods, and webform ab tests,
and validates group ownership of these nodes in a two-way, back-referenced manner which prevents the creation
of conflicting ownership configurations between a grouped webform and a grouped asset.

Springboard Groups improves the node-specific Group Membership UI by altering the
navigation structure to be more compact.

Springboard Groups provides a bulk-add members option.
